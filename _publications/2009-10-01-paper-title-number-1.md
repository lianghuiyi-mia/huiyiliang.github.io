excerpt: 'Enhancing emotion regulation (ER) among university students is essential for improving their academic performance and psychological well-being. MindfulReframer, a novel Virtual Reality (VR) system, represents the first interactive tool to help students manage exam-related anxiety by teaching Cognitive Reappraisal (CR) strategies through Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT). Immersing participants in realistic exam scenarios guides them to identify negative thoughts, foster mindful awareness, and practice CR in an interactive thought space. A mixed-methods evaluation showed significant improvements in reappraising stressful thoughts and regulating emotions (p =.003). The metaphor-driven, immersive design externalizes emotions, promotes non-judgmental awareness, and enhances cognitive flexibility, supporting better control over negative emotions and effective CR. MindfulReframer addresses a critical gap in mental health interventions for academic stress management and everyday emotion regulation.'
