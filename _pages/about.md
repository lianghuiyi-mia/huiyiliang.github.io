ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mia!
I grew up in China(Guangzhou). In 2020, I hopped on a plane to Australia to start my study adventure. Currently working as a research assistant at the University of Melbourne, exploring the world of digital health. Iâ€™m curious about how technology can (actually) make our everyday lives healthier and happier.

ðŸŽ“ I did my undergrad in Psychology and then a Masterâ€™s in Data Science, both at Monash Univeristy. So yes, I can both listen to your feelings and analyse your data.

ðŸ’¡ My research passion sits at the crossroads of people, technology, and wellbeing. I get excited about interdisciplinary projects and love collaborating across different fields.

ðŸ“¬ Always open for chats about research ideas, potential collaborations, or just making new friends. Feel free to reach out by emailâ€”donâ€™t be shy, I promise Iâ€™m friendly!


My journey
======
My academic journey kicked off in late 2023 when I won my first research scholarship and spent three months on my first project. That short run hooked me for life and made me realize research suits me way more than I expected.

People tell me academic work is boring and repeats the same motions. I beg to differ. I love poking at a question until it coughs up an answer. Iâ€™m the kind of person who enjoys digging deep, letting the data do the talking, and avoiding grandiose fluff. Turning messy evidence into a clear, logical story is equal parts painful and wildly addictive...

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
